# Epistemology
A field of philosophy that is about the study of knowledge, what knowledge is, how we acquire it, and when it's not being boring as hell *how* knowledge is shaped on a societal level.
# Why talk about this?
As you've discussed before, the concept of Rational Objectivity is extremely iffy, if also Extremely Pervasive. Epistemology talks about the different ways knowledge is constructed or considered.
# What is knowledge?
In philosophy, knowledge has a fair few definitions surrounding it. 

One of those is Justified True Belief. It is a definition of knowledge. 

An example: 

 At 12:30 I look at a clock at it says 12:30, but what I don't realise is the clock is stopped, it's right twice a day and the time just happened to be correct when I looked at it.
I believed the clock to be telling the time, but it was stopped.
It was true that the time was 12:30, but the clock was only right by chance.

In this understanding, it wasn't really knowledge, if I had looked at the clock at 12:31or 1:30pm I would have believed the same thing, but would have been wrong.

# Why are we covering this
You're going to be taken through some tools of analysis in week 8. This week, we just talked about the background so it's not too overwhelming next week when we start talking about how to use this kind of philosophy. The aim of this is so that you can do analysis about the artist you choose for your final essay and to also improve your critical thinking skills.
