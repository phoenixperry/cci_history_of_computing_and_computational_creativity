### What is this class about 
---
Where do computers come from and what is computational creativity? This unit aims to give you a solid understanding of what computers are, where they came from and how they have led to specific forms of creative practice. 

The development of the computers we use today has a varied and interesting history connected to many aspects of the cultural history of the 20th and 21st century. This unit explores the visions for computing that the pioneers of computational technology had when they invented modern computing and how certain values become more dominant over time and why. The unit also explores the impact of women in the development of computing as it has become clear in recent years that important contributions from women have been overlooked.

With an understanding of how computational technologies came to be, this unit examines how specific forms of creative practice have evolved in parallel and how a new computational materiality has developed as a result. We will also examine ideas that underpin auto-generative practices in art and design and how technologies such as machine learning have led some to speculate about the creativity of AI systems.

### Learning Outcomes 
---
- Demonstrate a critical awareness of the history of computing. **(Research)**
- Articulate ideas of computational creativity. **(Analysis)**

---
### Attendance 
---
Be present. 

Unexcused abscesses are unacceptable as is late work. You will find I am understanding if you have real reasons for needing to miss class. However, these must be discussed with me and cannot become excessive. Just not turning up will negatively impact your grade.

--- 
## Evaluation 
--- 
I care about your competence, your passion, your bravery, your curiosity, your civic spirit, your generosity, your critical questioning and your moral compass.

I take for granted you will successfully fulfill the objectives above which are obvious such as attendance, participation, doing your weekly homework and presenting your thinking in class. Do not let yourself down in these ways.

It is the other areas here that I am curious to watch you explore and begin to understand. 

--- 
### Class Policy 
---
I require a respectful, safe and productive environment to be maintained in this classroom at all times. Beyond that, sustained disruption during presentations or lectures or general offensive behavior will not be tolerated.

---
### Assessment 
---
**An academic essay of 1000 words** exploring the creative practice and process of a particular computational practitioner. **(100%)**
