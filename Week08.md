# Power and Epistemic Injustices

## Knowledge and Stories

Stories have an interesting relationship to knowledge. A story can introduce us to new concepts, make us question our own ideas of the world, or help us realise we weren’t alone in our feelings. Stories are a means of teaching, reinforcing, and constructing knowledge.

Histories are also stories, much like stories a history can introduce us to new concepts, make us question our own ideas of the world, or if we can draw parallels help us realise we weren’t alone in our situation. Histories can teach, or reinforce, or construct ideas we have about the world.

## Power

Power, that is the structural and individual power over society that many hold, greatly affects how knowledge pools / knowledge bases on a societal level are shaped. In part this can be how marginalised groups are made to be seen by other groups, and how they are made to see themselves.

## Epistemic Injustices

Miranda Fricker comes forward with ideas of epistemic injustices which encapsulate how shared knowledge bases are impacted and sculpted by injustices on marginalised groups in particular.

The first she puts forward is Testimonial Injustice which is the dismissal of one’s ability to contribute knowledge due to how society marginalises them. This can be racism, Fricker brings up the novel To Kill a Mockingbird as an illustration of testimonial injustice on grounds of anti-black racism whereby Tom Robinson’s testimony and defences aren’t believed on the grounds of him being a black man and how this affects how what he says is interpreted and twisted through a white lens.

Hermenutical injustice is the second instance of epistemic injustice that Miranda Fricker discusses. 

Hermenutical injustice the inability to articulate something as the words (either literally the words, or the comprehension of words that do exist) don't exist in society or within an organisation. Perhaps the way of saying something has been erased, or structurally excluded. Another way this can expressed is how if a means of articulating something isn’t understood by other parties. Effectively, there’s no shared language for an area.
