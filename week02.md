### History of the Analytic Engine 
In 1801 the Frenchman Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a power loom that could base its weave (and hence the design on the fabric) upon a pattern automatically read from punched wooden cards, held together in a long row by rope. Descendants of these punched cards have been in use ever since (remember the "hanging chad" from the Florida presidential ballots of the year 2000?). 

Last week we established Babbage's early computer, the Difference Engine, was created for the purpose of tabulating mathematical tables and it was driven by the desire to quickly tabulate navigational data. (1821)

Babbage called the two main parts of his Analytic Engine the "Store" and the "Mill", as both terms are used in the weaving industry. The Store was where numbers were held and the Mill was where they were "woven" into new results. In a modern computer these same parts are called the memory unit and the central processing unit (CPU). 

### The start of IBM and Hermann Hollerith
The next major innovation came as a result of the need to count people by the US Government 
Punch card machines were invented by Hermann Hollerith to tabulate the 1890 U.S. Census; in 1911, Hollerithâ€™s firm became the core of a new company called IBM, which quickly dominated the business.

### Enigma Machines
In WW2, computing experienced a serious boom while the Allied Forces sought to crack German encryption. 
The problems the Germans proposed was one which simply required brute computing power to solve. This code was based on an early analog encryption device called the Enigma Device. These paired devices would need to be set identically to be able to de-encode encoded messages. These cyphers and cracking the setting on them, drove computing. The device was created just after WW1 and went through refinements through WW2.

### Bletchley Park 
We needed a computer to attempt to brute force de-encrypt the messages. The development of the computers at Bletchley Park was pivotal to cracking what became known as the Enigma Code. Alan Turring was a lead engineer.

It was programmed largely by women: https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/jul/24/meet-the-female-codebreakers-of-bletchley-park

Encryption cracking and communication plus the technology to detect and direct air and submarine traffic were the two major drivers of computing during WW2. 

In 1944, the UK lead the world in computing. 
By 1947, the industry was all but dead in the UK 

The true tragedy, and one of the reasons why the tech revolution was led by the US, has to do with the fact that the UK government, unlike the US, systematically neglected to hire women in programming jobs after the war and sent them back into their lives as homemakers. Imagine what the UK could have become if it had not blatantly discriminated against the highly skilled workforce it has already trained?  

### The Mark 1 
To meet missile guidance demands during World War II, IBM and Harvard University teamed up to create the Harvard Mark I, a mechanical computer eight feet tall and fifty-one feet wide. This was the first modern computer. 

Columbia University features detailed photographs and more information on their Mark I history site.

This computer could be programmed to do more than one specific task and is the first digital computer in the US. The Mark I was constructed out of switches, relays, rotating shafts, and clutches. The machine weighed 5 tons, incorporated 500 miles of wire, was 8 feet tall and 51 feet long, and had a 50 ft rotating shaft running its length, turned by a 5-horsepower electric motor. The Mark I ran non-stop for 15 years.  

### Grace Hopper 
Women, particularly those who majored or worked in mathematics, famously programmed these early computing machines. The most notable of the Mark I programmers was Grace Hopper who invented the first object-oriented programming language, the compiler and the term "bug" because she found an actual bug in the Mark 1 which had stopped it from working. 

### In Class creative brief: Create a piece of speculative fiction.  
Break into groups of 4. Research a woman from Bletchley Park and re-write her history as if the British Government would have celebrated women in computing verses refuse to employee them. What else might she have done? Imagine a world where women were treated equally and encouraged to continue innovating. Could the UK, not the US, have gone on to lead the world in computer science? How would the tech we use how change? 

Time: 1 hour then class group presentations  

### Reading: 
Recoding Gender: Women's Changing Participation in Computing Chapters 1-3 
Programmed Inequality: How Britain Discarded Women Technologists and Lost Its Edge in Computing  Chapters 1 & 2

### Homework: 
Creative brief: What was the test Turing faced? Research the life of Alan Turing. Deconstruct how the government treated him after the war and compare it with the lense of texts above. Did structural misogyny impact his life? Consider the cost of enforced ideas of masculinity in a society. Write a paragraph and be prepared to share it with the group next week.

### Deconstruction 
What does it mean to deconstrut something?
