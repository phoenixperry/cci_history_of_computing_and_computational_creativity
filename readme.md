### What is this class about 
Where do computers come from and what is computational creativity? This unit aims to give you a solid understanding of what computers are, where they came from and how they have led to specific forms of creative practice. 

The development of the computers we use today has a varied and interesting history connected to many aspects of the cultural history of the 20th and 21st century. This unit explores the visions for computing that the pioneers of computational technology had when they invented modern computing and how certain values become more dominant over time and why. The unit also explores the impact of women in the development of computing as it has become clear in recent years that important contributions from women have been overlooked.

With an understanding of how computational technologies came to be, this unit examines how specific forms of creative practice have evolved in parallel and how a new computational materiality has developed as a result. We will also examine ideas that underpin auto-generative practices in art and design and how technologies such as machine learning have led some to speculate about the creativity of AI systems.

## Week 1 - When did the ideas in computer science start? 

--- 

To start any good story, we need to begin at the beginning. To understand the problems, we need to understand the ideas first. What is about to follow is a collection of ideas, some from Simon Penny's Making Sense, some from Caliban and the Witch, some from my general understanding of colonialism I first got from Edward Said and Octavia Butler

#### History of maps 

•Astronomy, mapping, and cartography were major sciences in Islamic culture and Europeans on the edge of the Islamic world also developed an interest. 

•Norman king Roger II of Sicily (1130-1154) employed Islamic cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi on his massive cartography project to create the world’s first accurate map. This map stood for the next 300 years. 

•John II, Christian king of the recently Islamic territory of Portugal (1481-1495), had the idea to establish a system for gathering and processing observations and measurements made at sea. This data was collected and tabulated in a standardized representational framework. 

••These maps were created because European aristocracy developed a taste for sugar, which as a result of the Reconquista, the Arabs refused to sell to them. 

•They traveled the world looking for an ideal location to cultivate it. 

•They tried along Balearic Islands, Arab North Africa and finally off the coast of modern Nigeria where they brought slaves from Nigeria to farm. 

•After Columbus discovered Hispaniola and within a decade (by 1501), both the sugar and slave trade were exported to the Caribbean. 

•In 1526, the first Portuguese slave ships arrived and kicked off 350 years of large-scale transatlantic slave trade in which 12.5 million people were displaced. 

Sidney Mintz. 1985. Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History. 

#### Navigation as Computation 

How do you represent a round surface on a flat plane to make a western map? It must be projected. Meet the The Mercator projection from 1569. 
![The Mercator projection 1569](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Mercator_projection_Square.JPG)

Cost? It becomes wildly inaccurate at the poles. 
Other tools used to collect data, campus, nautical chart, protractors, parallel rulers, charts - all of this forms a very early analog system of computation

These sort of tools and systems of computing space are the fundamental building blocks of colonialism, empire and capitalism. 

**What do top down maps infer?**  

A god view. You are fundamentally outside of this map looking down like a god. You are disembodied from the space you are viewing. The world becomes the other. 

![engage god mode](https://media1.giphy.com/media/QuAfzNbVqIcLe/giphy.gif?cid=790b76112fbd2aaf1d02cc3aa32a7bdc2c5ab7c94caa0b51&rid=giphy.gif)



**Where did this concept of nature come from?**  

![Decartes](https://media1.giphy.com/media/WXcDyH7ZuVKmY/giphy.gif?cid=790b76111780befd0a21631d05270ec0455c5a8066fc22c3&rid=giphy.gif)

These ideas of objective, logical thinking separate being outside of the natural world originated with Rene Descartes and his fellow cartesians. He and the rest of his peers sought to establish Cartesian thinking as a replacement for the ideas of Aristotle. Their popularity in western thought helps to lay the foundation for the Enlightenment coming in the next century.

Descartes is credited at beginning the school of thought called rationalism which asserted that there was important knowledge that could be gained without the senses through reason alone. 

Notice carefully here this separation of the sensorial from the logical. It becomes a fundamental flaw of western thought and manifests in computing systems. 

Dualism - the thought schism that allows white men to objectify others. (in my humble opinion)

The separation of natural world and the self is fundamental to western otherness and it was popularized during this period. 

Descartes came to the conclusion that the mind was completely separate from the body. In philosophy of mind, what constitutes the “Mind Body Problem” is that the experience of consciousness and the physical processes of the brain and sensory body seem so at odds with each other.

Now, let's go back to maps and think about how these ideas are manifested in our creation of top down maps. 

How do these two things relate to each other? The entire navigation system uses the cartesian coordinate system which, is in fact, created by Descartes. 

This way of thinking and map making goes on to be largely responsible for the success of the Western world in navigation. 

Various tables and the math of computing sailing routes become key to datasets and these pre-electronic databases are the first of their kind. 

Computing navigational data becomes the first code. 

Charles Babbage's difference engine was to prepare tide tables for the British Navy. 
These tables helped support the superiority of the British fleet. 

Ada Lovelace writes the first program for Babbage's computer. 
What did Lovelace's code actually do? 

She thought carefully about how operations could be organized into groups that could be repeated, thereby inventing the loop. She realized how important it was to track the state of variables as they changed, introducing a notation to illustrate those changes.

This marks the beginning of computing's very problematic history with extending military state prowess.  

**What else happens during these same years as Descartes was othering the mind from the body?** 
The Witch Hunts and the breaking of the power of women in culture 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmk47kh7fiE&t=1497s 

I'm going to let the internet make this point for me but this subjugation of women is very important to understand as it becomes a theme in the history of computing and manifests itself today in the gender problems in the field. 

The same happens for racial bias. How could a technology which has its roots in slavery and military dominance of the earth ever, possibly be good for it? 

We need new ways to imagine tech and that's what I hope you are all here to help us do.

#### Can you make a map another way? 

Turns out that this is just one way of thinking.... it's not truth. **It's just a set of ideas.** 

Cognition in the Wild by Edwin Hutchins describes Micronesian navigation system

![navigation from a compass where the self is within the environment](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQwWTSnhok3IkfuP6h5D9-qpbYIh8FQE3Ndm81xknuzeNAfiv7e)

Turns out these folks navigated huge parts of the world without traditional maps. 

There is no disembodied other in their understanding of space and territory. 

We believe that to navigate there must be a map, or at least a mental map. Turns out this is just one way of doing things. 

They do not create multiple selves. Their approach is inherently deictic. 

The observer is at the center of the system. The system builds around them. There is no dissociation between the experiential and the schematic. 

**It assumes the navigator and the stars remain in a fixed potion and the world flows around them.** 

Each way of moving through space works. 

Each assumes different understandings of reality and each understanding makes some ways of thinking more or less possible.

## Week 02 The late 1800's to WW2 and the start of modern computing  
-- 

In 1801 the Frenchman Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a power loom that could base its weave (and hence the design on the fabric) upon a pattern automatically read from punched wooden cards, held together in a long row by rope. Descendants of these punched cards have been in use ever since (remember the "hanging chad" from the Florida presidential ballots of the year 2000?). 

Last week we established Babbage's early computer, the Difference Engine, was created for the purpose of tabulating mathematical tables and it was driven by the desire to quickly tabulate navigational data. (1821)

Babbage called the two main parts of his Analytic Engine the "Store" and the "Mill", as both terms are used in the weaving industry. The Store was where numbers were held and the Mill was where they were "woven" into new results. In a modern computer these same parts are called the memory unit and the central processing unit (CPU). 

The next major innovation came as a result of the need to count people by the US Government 
Punch card machines were invented by Hermann Hollerith to tabulate the 1890 U.S. Census; in 1911, Hollerith’s firm became the core of a new company called IBM, which quickly dominated the business.

In WW2, computing experienced a serious boom while the Allied Forces sought to crack German encryption. 
The problems the Germans proposed was one which simply required brute computing power to solve. This code was based on an early analog encryption device called the Enigma Device. These paired devices would need to be set identically to be able to de-encode encoded messages. These cyphers and cracking the setting on them, drove computing. The device was created just after WW1 and went through refinements through WW2. 

Video of how this machine works:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASfAPOiq_eQ

To read more about all the devices: 
https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/hist.htm 

We needed a computer to attempt to brute force de-encrypt the messages. The development of the computers at Bletchley Park was pivotal to cracking what became known as the Enigma Code. Alan Turring was a lead engineer.

It was programmed largely by women: https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/jul/24/meet-the-female-codebreakers-of-bletchley-park

Encryption cracking and communication plus the technology to detect and direct air and submarine traffic were the two major drivers of computing during WW2. 

In 1944, the UK lead the world in computing. 
By 1947, the industry was all but dead in the UK 

The true tragedy, and one of the reasons why the tech revolution was led by the US, has to do with the fact that the UK government, unlike the US, systematically neglected to hire women in programming jobs after the war and sent them back into their lives as homemakers. Imagine what the UK could have become if it had not blatantly discriminated against the highly skilled workforce it has already trained?  

To meet missile guidance demands during World War II, IBM and Harvard University teamed up to create the Harvard Mark I, a mechanical computer eight feet tall and fifty-one feet wide. This was the first modern computer. 

Columbia University features detailed photographs and more information on their Mark I history site.

This computer could be programmed to do more than one specific task and is the first digital computer in the US. The Mark I was constructed out of switches, relays, rotating shafts, and clutches. The machine weighed 5 tons, incorporated 500 miles of wire, was 8 feet tall and 51 feet long, and had a 50 ft rotating shaft running its length, turned by a 5-horsepower electric motor. The Mark I ran non-stop for 15 years.  

Women, particularly those who majored or worked in mathematics, famously programmed these early computing machines. The most notable of the Mark I programmers was Grace Hopper who invented the first object-oriented programming language, the compiler and the term "bug" because she found an actual bug in the Mark 1 which had stopped it from working. 

### In Class creative brief: Create a piece of speculative fiction.  
Break into groups of 4. Research a woman from Bletchley Park and re-write her history as if the British Government would have celebrated women in computing verses refuse to employee them. What else might she have done? Imagine a world where women were treated equally and encouraged to continue innovating. Could the UK, not the US, have gone on to lead the world in computer science? How would the tech we use how change? 

Time: 1 hour then class group presentations  

### Reading: 
Recoding Gender: Women's Changing Participation in Computing Chapters 1-3 
Programmed Inequality: How Britain Discarded Women Technologists and Lost Its Edge in Computing  Chapters 1 & 2

### Homework: 
Creative brief: What was the test Turing faced? Research the life of Alan Turing. Deconstruct how the government treated him after the war and compare it with the lense of texts above. Did structural misogyny impact his life? Consider the cost of enforced ideas of masculinity in a society. Write a paragraph and be prepared to share it with the group next week.
