Where do computers come from and what is computational creativity? This unit aims to give you a solid understanding of what computers are, where they came from and how they have led to specific forms of creative practice. 

The development of the computers we use today has a varied and interesting history connected to many aspects of the cultural history of the 20th and 21st century. This unit explores the visions for computing that the pioneers of computational technology had when they invented modern computing and how certain values become more dominant over time and why. The unit also explores the impact of women in the development of computing as it has become clear in recent years that important contributions from women have been overlooked.

With an understanding of how computational technologies came to be, this unit examines how specific forms of creative practice have evolved in parallel and how a new computational materiality has developed as a result. We will also examine ideas that underpin auto-generative practices in art and design and how technologies such as machine learning have led some to speculate about the creativity of AI systems.
